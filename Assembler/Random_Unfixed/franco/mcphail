                 Startup of Compac AT
                 ____________________

     To start the Compac AT, just turn on the PC.  If the PC was brought down
for some reason before, then give the Compac PC AT at least 2 minutes to
the AS/400 to recover from a PC shutdown.


                File transfer to the 400
                ________________________

     The file from the PC will be transfered every minute to the AS/400.  The
only way the PC cannot send to the 400 is 1) the 400 is down 2) communications
droped 3) the 400 (SMSAT) session was not started 4) something wrong with PC.


                   Protocol Overview
                   _________________

     This protocol is between the Compac AT and the IBM AT (Scale AT).
The protocol is very unique, it is made up of three parts (start,data,check).
For the start (HEX 02), this is sent at the beginning of every string of info.
Next is the data, which can be any lenght, and any character above (HEX 20).
The last part is a check or checksum followed by a charage return.  This check
is calculated on the actual data it self (a detailed description of how to
calculate the checksum can be obtained from Accusort).
     When the Compac AT starts up it will send out ('107IAH126').  The other
AT will send back an acknowledgement ('106ACK0EB').  Now both machines are
ready for transmitting and recieveing.  If the IBM AT sends a bad record to
the Compac AT, then the Compac will send a NAK back.  Then the IBM AT will
re-transmit the record.
