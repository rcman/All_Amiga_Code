Version I.01

The MOVEM instruction now works with all address registers, not just a7, when
using the indirect addressing mode, e.g MOVEM.L d0-d1,(a0) now works.

When sending an assembler listing to a file and a line was longer then LLEN
the assembler freaked out and started to write several megabytes of spaces.
This has now been corrected.


Version I.02

The menus doesn't trash under KickStart 2.0 anymore.

CMP[.SIZE] (An)+,(An)+ is now properly converted to CMPM[.SIZE] (An)+,(An)+
and doesn't report 'Invalid operand'.

MOVE[.SIZE] SR,.. now works and doesn't report 'Undefined symbol ->SR'.

XREFing a symbol more then once doesn't report 'Redefined symbol' .

CLR, NEG, NEGX, NOT & TST now assums .W as default (as it should be) if no
size is specified and doesn't report 'Invalid operand'.
